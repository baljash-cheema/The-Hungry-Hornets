Project Theme:
We would like to explore the relationship between officer compliance with department medical
policy including but not limited to incidents of drug and alcohol abuse, with allegations of police
misconduct, officer salary and rank, use of force by police, location and type of police work
conducted, and distribution of awards given by the department. We will explore these
relationships with other aspects of health as the data allows for.

Question 1:
Among officers who have drug and alcohol abuse or medical allegations against them,
how often are they co-accused? How does this co-accusal pattern vary based on whether
officers earn below or above the average annual salary across the full department?

Question 2:
Among officers who have drug & alcohol abuse and medical allegations against them,
how does the co-accusal pattern compare between more and less decorated officers?
Specifically, how does the co-accusal pattern compare between those with more and
less than the average number of award types won, respectively?
