Checkpoint 5:
We would like to build a natural language model that allows users to ask questions directly regarding drug and alcohol abuse allegations, which returns answers accordingly. Here are some examples:
1. Among officers with drug and alcohol abuse allegations, who has the highest salary?
2. What are the names of officers who have 5+ drug and alcohol abuse allegations? Evaluation Method: In order to evaluate this question and answering NLP model, we can get ground truth by performing analytics on the CPDP database, using DataGrip, and match this with the reply from the natural language model. With this data, we will be plotting accuracy, precision, F-score and a confusion matrix.
