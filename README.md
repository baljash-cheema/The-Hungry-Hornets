Hungry Hornets)

Project Theme:
We would like to explore the relationship between officer compliance with department medical
policy including but not limited to incidents of drug and alcohol abuse, with allegations of police
misconduct, officer salary and rank, use of force by police, location and type of police work
conducted, and distribution of awards given by the department. We will explore these
relationships with other aspects of health as the data allows for.
