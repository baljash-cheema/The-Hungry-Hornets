Project Theme: We would like to explore the relationship between officer compliance with department medical policy including but not limited to incidents of drug and alcohol abuse, with allegations of police misconduct, officer salary and rank, use of force by police, location and type of police work conducted, and distribution of awards given by the department. We will explore these relationships with other aspects of health as the data permits.

For our second checkpoint, we created visualizations to answer the following questions:

1) Are officers with drug/alcohol abuse allegations more or less likely to be disciplined as a result of the fallout of the allegation, compared with officers with all other kinds of misconduct allegations?

We visualized this with two adjacent pie graphs, showing percentage disciplined versus not disciplined in each group. The SQL code under the src directory was utilized to generate the data, which was then visualized in Tableau.

2) Is the frequency of drug/alcohol abuse allegations versus all other allegations changing over time? We will visualize this with a connected scatterplot.

The SQL code under the src directory contains our query data. The output was augmented with the Python code under src as well. This was then uploaded into Tableau to generate a plot with the two lines.
