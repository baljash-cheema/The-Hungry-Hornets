Our task here is to clean dirty data entered into the following trr tables:

-trr_trr_refresh
-trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
-trr_charge_refresh
-trr_subjectweapon_refresh
-trr_trrstatus_refresh
-trr_weapondischarge_refresh

For this assignment, we will be using OpenRefine, Python with the pandas package, and Datagrip to access the CPDP database. 

2.1 Type Correction 
For this portion, our goal is to type correct certain columns within 3 of these tables:

1. trr_trr_refresh
2. trr_weapondischarge_refresh
3. trr_trrstatus_refresh

We first access the CPDP database using OpenRefine.  

For trr_trr_refresh and trr_treestatus_refresh, please load the table and run the JSON file associated with each. 

Next, export all 3 tables (trr_weapondischarge_refresh left in its original form), to CSVs.

These CSVs are then to be loaded in Python as file1 (trr_trr_refresh), file2 (trr_weapondischarge_refresh), and file3 (trr_trrstatus_refresh).

Please execute the provided Python file. This will output the 3 corrected tables for this component of the assignment.
