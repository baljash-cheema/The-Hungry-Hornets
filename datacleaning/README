Our task here is to clean dirty data entered into the following trr tables:

-trr_trr_refresh
-trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
-trr_charge_refresh
-trr_subjectweapon_refresh
-trr_trrstatus_refresh
-trr_weapondischarge_refresh

For this assignment, we will be using OpenRefine, Python with the pandas package, and Datagrip to access the CPDP database. 

2.1 Type Correction 
For this portion, our goal is to type correct certain columns within 3 of these tables:

1. trr_trr_refresh
2. trr_weapondischarge_refresh
3. trr_trrstatus_refresh

We first access the CPDP database using OpenRefine.  

For trr_trr_refresh and trr_treestatus_refresh, please load the table and run the JSON file associated with each. 

Next, export all 3 tables (trr_weapondischarge_refresh) left in its original form, to CSVs.

These CSVs are then to be loaded in Python as file1 (trr_trr_refresh), file2 (trr_weapondischarge_refresh), and file3 (trr_trrstatus_refresh).

Please execute the provided Python file. 



trr_trr_refresh
-trr_datetime - not done
-beat - done
-officer_appointed_date - need to fix
-officer_birth_year - done
-officer_age - done
-officer_on_duty - bool
-officer_injured - bool
-officer_in_uniform - bool
-subject_birth_year - done
-subject_age - done
-subject_armed - bool
-subject_injured - bool
-subject_alleged_injury	- bool
-notify_oemc - bool
-notify_district_sergeant - bool
-notify_op_command - bool
-notify_det_division - bool
-trr_created - timestamp 





1. Download from Datagrip postgres the CSVs for the 6 tables, adding column headers.
2. Upload CSVs into open refine:
trr_trr_refresh
done - beat, officer appointed date, birth year, age, subject_birth year, subject_age,
skipped - date/time

trr_weapondischarge_refresh

trr_trrstatus_refresh
done - officer birth year, officer appointed date
skipped - status_datetime



1. Download tables from Datagrip
2. Open in OpenRefine -> run JSON code for trr_trrstatus_refresh and trr_trr_refresh
3. Export each to CSV
4. Open in Python using pandas
5. Edit
