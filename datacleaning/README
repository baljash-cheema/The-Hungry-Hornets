Our task here is to clean dirty data entered into the following trr tables:

-trr_trr_refresh
-trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
-trr_charge_refresh
-trr_subjectweapon_refresh
-trr_trrstatus_refresh
-trr_weapondischarge_refresh

For this assignment, we will be using DataGrip to access the CPDP database, OpenRefine, and Python with the pandas package. We will describe each step in detail.

Step 1:
Please download the following tables from DataGrip accessing the CPDP database and save as CSVs:

1. trr_trr_refresh
2. trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
3. trr_charge_refresh
4. trr_subjectweapon_refresh
5. trr_trrstatus_refresh
6. trr_weapondischarge_refresh
7. data_officer

Each of these files is saved as postgres_public_ followed by the table name, finished with .csv in our src/csv/original directory. Please maintain this naming convention. 

Example: 'postgres_public_data_officer.csv'

Step 2:
'postgres_public_trr_trr_refresh.csv' and 'postgres_public_trr_trrstatus_refresh.csv' are run through OpenRefine using the JSON files under the src directory named after the table they correspond to. The output is saved as a CSV named the same as the original under csv/after_openrefine. 

Step 3:
Run main.py. It will pull in CSV files from csv/original and csv/after_openrefine and run them through various functions designed to clean the data. As the files move through each function, they will be output to a directory corresponding to the action that was just taken on them. For example, they will move to csv/after_typecorrection after the typecorrection function is called. 

Step 4;
The final CSVs will be found under the output directory within the main directory.
