Our task here is to clean dirty data entered into the following trr tables:

-trr_trr_refresh
-trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
-trr_charge_refresh
-trr_subjectweapon_refresh
-trr_trrstatus_refresh
-trr_weapondischarge_refresh

For this assignment, we will be using DataGrip to access the CPDP database, OpenRefine, and Python with the pandas package. We will describe each step in detail.

The following packages from Python will be needed:
csv
datetime
numpy
re
datetime
pandas

Step 1:
The following tables have been downloaded by the CPDP database using DataGrip as CSVs with column headers. 

1. trr_trr_refresh
2. trr_trr_actionresponse_refresh
3. trr_charge_refresh
4. trr_subjectweapon_refresh
5. trr_trrstatus_refresh
6. trr_weapondischarge_refresh
7. data_officer
8. data_policeunit


Step 2:
'postgres_public_trr_trr_refresh.csv','postgres_public_trr_trrstatus_refresh.csv', and 'postgres_public_trr_subjectweapon_refresh.csv' are run through OpenRefine using the JSON files under the src directory named after the table they correspond to. The output is to be saved as a CSV named the same as the original under csv/after_openrefine. 

Step 3:
Run main.py. It will pull in CSV files from csv/original and csv/after_openrefine and run them through various functions designed to clean the data. As the files move through each function, they will move through a series of directories to track flow through the program. The locations of the files that run through this are hard coded into the Python file, so please maintain the naming convention. 

Step 4;
The final CSVs will be found under the output directory within the main directory, after the primary and foreign keys have been aligned.
